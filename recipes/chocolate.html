        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This recipe creates rich and creamy chocolate that melts in your mouth. Perfect for snacking, gifting, or using in your favorite desserts</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 cup cocoa powder</li>
            <li>1/2 cup coconut oil (or cocoa butter for a richer taste)</li>
            <li>1/4 cup powdered sugar (adjust to taste)</li>
            <li>1 tsp vanilla extract</li>
            <li>A pinch of salt</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Prepare Your Workspace: Ensure your work area is clean and dry. Water can cause the chocolate to seize. Line a baking sheet or a chocolate mold with parchment paper.</li>
            <li>Melt the Coconut Oil (or Cocoa Butter): In a double boiler or a heatproof bowl set over a pot of simmering water, melt the coconut oil (or cocoa butter). Stir occasionally until completely melted.</li>
            <li>Mix in Cocoa Powder: Sift the cocoa powder to remove any lumps. Gradually add the sifted cocoa powder to the melted oil, stirring continuously until smooth and well combined.</li>
            <li>Add Sweeteners and Flavorings: Add the powdered sugar, a little at a time, and stir until fully dissolved. You can adjust the amount of sugar based on your taste preference. Stir in the vanilla extract and a pinch of salt. Mix well.</li>
            <li>Pour and Set: Pour the chocolate mixture into the prepared baking sheet or molds. Use a spatula to spread it evenly if necessary. If desired, sprinkle sea salt flakes or additional toppings on top of the chocolate.</li>
            <li>Chill the Chocolate:Place the chocolate in the refrigerator for at least 1 hour, or until it is completely set and firm.</li>
            <li>Break and Serve: Once set, break the chocolate into pieces if you used a baking sheet, or pop them out of the molds. Store the chocolate in an airtight container in the refrigerator to prevent melting.</li>
        </ol>
