        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>These classic waffles are light and crispy on the outside, fluffy on the inside, and perfect for breakfast or brunch. Serve them with your favorite toppings such as fresh fruits, whipped cream, syrup, or butter.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons sugar</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon baking powder</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>2 large eggs</li>
            <li>1 3/4 cups milk</li>
            <li>1/2 cup vegetable oil (or melted butter)</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat your waffle iron according to the manufacturer's instructions.</li>
            <li>Mix Dry Ingredients: In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt until well combined.</li>
            <li>Mix Wet Ingredients: In a separate bowl, beat the eggs. Add the milk, vegetable oil (or melted butter), and vanilla extract. Mix until well combined.</li>
            <li>Combine Wet and Dry Ingredients: Pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients. Stir until just combined. Be careful not to overmix; some small lumps are okay.</li>
            <li>Cook the Waffles: Lightly grease the preheated waffle iron with cooking spray or a little oil. Pour enough batter into the waffle iron to just cover the waffle grid. Close the waffle iron and cook until the waffles are golden brown and crisp. This typically takes about 3-5 minutes, but follow your waffle iron's specific instructions.</li>
            <li>Serve: Remove the waffle and place it on a wire rack (this helps keep them crispy). Repeat with the remaining batter. Serve the waffles warm with your favorite toppings.</li>
        </ol>
